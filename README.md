Created for Ludum Dare 50 (Jam category), in collaboration with Greg Wang and congus bongus.

## Overview
Escape Horizon is a survival-based game where you are a space ship trying to escape a black hole thatâ€™s growing from consuming space debris. To do so you must maneuver the space debris out of the way of the black hole and back into the depths of space.

Keep this up to stay out of the way of the black hole, though eventually, the hole will consume all. How long can you last and keep the hole at bay before its size starts to get out of hand?
